# Documentation for exporting data from duckdb
This document describes how to export data from DuckDB to CSV, Excel, and JSON files, with example queries.

# CSV Export
To export the data from a table to a CSV file, use the COPY statement.

```
COPY {table} TO '{./filename}' (HEADER, DELIMITER ',');
```

# Excel Export
To export the data from a table to an Excel file, install and load the spatial extension. This is only needed once per DuckDB connection.

```
INSTALL spatial;
LOAD spatial;
```

Then use the COPY statement. The file will contain one worksheet with the same name as the file, but without the .xlsx extension.
### Note
Dates and timestamps are currently not supported by the xlsx writer. Cast columns of those types to VARCHAR prior to creating the xlsx file.

```
COPY {table} TO './{filename}' WITH (FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER 'xlsx');
```

# JSON Export

To export the data from a table to a JSON file, use the COPY statement.

```
COPY {table} TO './{filename}';
```
